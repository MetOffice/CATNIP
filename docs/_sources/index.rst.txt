The CATNIP library
======================

All the functions in the CATNIP library have been through a QA procedure, detailed in the QA instructions section below. All functions should be:

* Compatible with Python 2 and 3.
* Follow the `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ styling guidelines. We recommend `Flake8 <https://pypi.org/project/flake8/>`_ as one of the tools for enforcing PEP8 guidelines.
* Include a docstring that follows either `numpy or google <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html>`_ docstring style. 
* Include a doctest.
* Have a github issue and code review associated with them.
* Have been reviewed by someone other than the original author.

**Note:** As of Jan 2020 *module load scitools/default* is currently the preferred software stack.
