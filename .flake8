# We want to reduce the max-complexity over time - this allows
# us to cap it at the worst we currently have (add_time_coord_cats)
max-complexity = 22
# Ignores as suggested on Yammer
# E123, E133 describe styles for closing bracket.
# E226 Due to whitespace around operators (e.g. 2*x + 3).
# W503 Break before binary operator is preferred by PEP8
# E721 do not compare types, use 'isinstance()' - need to compare type of 2
#      objects. When using later versions of flake8 will be possible
#       to apply this ignore to only 1 file.
# E402 module level import not at top of file - violated by setting Agg
#
# These are ones we want to remove later but keep for now. Need issues for
# these. In order of importance
#
# These all relate to use of * imports
# F403 import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
# F405 may be undefined, or defined from star imports
# F401 imported but unused - causes failure in test_visualisation due to
#      use of wildcard import. Rethink approach here?
